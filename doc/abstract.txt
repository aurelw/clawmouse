Click Work has become the new, global minimum wage job. Working with keyboard and mouse, once a prestigious office job now pays just enough to survive. A claw machine is transformed into a computer mouse. The means of directly controlling the claw are taken from the worker. Instead, data annotation has to be performed. The worker is reimbursed and fed by the machine.
